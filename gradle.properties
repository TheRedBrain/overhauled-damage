update_changelog=No longer adds status effects, in the server config the ids of effects implemented by other mods can be specified instead. This mod is an API, so I felt that adding content like status effects is not in scope for this project. This gives mod (pack) authors more control and reduces dependencies and jar size. Also, no more assets are missing (or needed), so the mod is no longer in beta.\
  \n- no longer depends on Spell Engine, because it's ActionImpairing API is no longer needed\
  \n- added Mod Menu support\
  \n- fixed an issue where the folder containing the config files was not named correctly
